    <p>Now I learned the &lt;p> tag which stands for paragraph. Basically the tag &lt;h*> stands for heading 
        and using this tag compiles all the text together. Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.

        <!--I'm adding comments here just for kicks.-->

        There are 6 different levels of headings which range from &lt;<1 to 6> and this represents it's level the largest a most important is 1 (duh), while h6 is the tiniest level.
            We also find the &lt;strong> which makes text <strong>bold.</strong> Another element we see is the &lt;em> which makes your text <em>italic.</em>

    <h1>Nesting and Indentation</h1>

    <p>You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson we indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known as nesting elements.
        Nesting elements withing other elements creates the "parent" and "child" relationship.
        Elements nested at the same level are considered siblings.

    <h1>HTML Comments</h1>
    We have reached the comment section! {LoL} Comments in html are written by enclosing the comment with &lt;!-- and --> tags.
